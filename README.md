# AddressPage

###Utilizing PHP and JQuery to load and fill an address form.


This page was built as an improvement to a previous address page, and it uses much of the same calls to the database and the same HTML. Errors that were not caught on the previous form have been corrected and information being submitted to the database has been corrected.


The inclusion of JQuery to load intermediary page and POST to page was also an improvement.
